Lets try to implement what Bodo Schaefer says and see if it work.
For noe I'm just have anough money to leave and go to vocation one time per year.
If I lose the job, propably bu budget will be in 2 - 3 month equal zero.

Bodo promise if I read the book and make all what he says, in 7 years I can be financial independend. 
Lets try it.

First of all I will read the book and write all things that need to do. 
This is will be my plan for the next 7 years.

Lets start to make summary from the book...

# 1 Chapter

> Poor makes peaople unhappy.

In my opinion it's true, because money give you a freedom to make what you want and to choose by yourself.
On the other side money can also make you unhappy if you allow the money to controll you.

> Without self confidence you still live minimal existence. The man withoout self confidance makes nothing, has nothing and is nothing.[^1]  

Althrought I have no money, I must still self confidence.  

> My art to thinking makes me what I be now.  

To be where I waht to be I need to change way of thinking.

> 5 areas of our life: healt, finances, relationships, emotions and sense of life.
> Everyvone eho has a problem with the money, has some problem in this 5 areas of life.  

> Either you plan your life or another plan it.

# 2 Chapter

> Who you blame, you give the power to.

> You a not responsible for all events that happens, but you are responsible for interpretation of the events.

Why is **reading** important?
Reading is important, because the reading is words. The words are new ideas. Ideas are the most expensive.
Also develop reading our vocabulary. And the more is our vocabulary the bigger is our income.[^2]

Write your own success journal. Write every day what what you have done well. You are enought important to write about yourself.[^3]

It is easy to be rich but it is also easy to be poor. It

The life is like a shipping house. We get exact what we want.[^4]
Bodo says "I have now exact that, what I wish to me 10 years ago. I did'n have more then that."

Find a good financial coach. He should at least have ten times more money as you.[^5]

My strength and weakness:  
**Weakness**:
- doubtfulness
- fear of conflict
- I leave things unfinished
- putting things off for later

**Strength**
- take a risk
- strategic planning

Your strength makes you rich.

To get the answers, start to write. Writing is thinking. Thinking can give you answers for your questions.

Today you have exact that, what you think is good for you.

Have 500 EUR always in your pocket. It's give you more self confidence with money.

Search for new income source.

Without discipline, any talent is nothing.
