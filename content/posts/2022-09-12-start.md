Hello, my name is Mykola and this is my blog.  
I love my job as a programmer and I want to share with you my life and work in this blog.  

The blog was created on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo allows to create a blog post in markdown language, what in my case brings a pleasure.   
Theme that was used is [Cactus](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-cactus/).
The blog is deployed on GitHub pages. There is good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4) about deployment.

# Start

From this day I sart my journy to live which I want to live.

> Now is the time to get serious about living your ideals. How long can you afford to put off who you really want to be? Your nobler self cannot wait any longer. Put your principles into practice – now. Stop the excuses and the procrastination. This is your life! You aren’t a child anymore. The sooner you set yourself to your spiritual program, the happier you will be. The longer you wait, the more you’ll be vulnerable to mediocrity and feel filled with shame and regret, because you know you are capable of better. From this instant on, vow to stop disappointing yourself. Separate yourself from the mob. Decide to be extraordinary and do what you need to do – now.
